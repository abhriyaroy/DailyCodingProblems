# DailyCodingProblems

A compilation of algorithmic challenges from daily coding problem that I am going to solve over the course of time. 
This will help anyone who is preparing for technical interviews for jobs or any other purpose.

I tried to provide the most optimal algorithm I could think of. However, if anyone else has a better approach or solution to the problem
then you are most welcome to raise a pull request so that we can learn and grow together.

The problems here are taken from [Daily Coding Problems](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/).

Hope this helps!
